Roman is freelance software developer involved in various software products, both proprietary and open source. I'm also a supporter and advocate of open source cross platform solutions running on multiple form factors. Since 2016 Roman has been working with schools based in developing countries, mostly on development, implementation and support of offline and online solutions, based on Gibbon and DebianEdu.
