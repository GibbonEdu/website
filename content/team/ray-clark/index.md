Ray is a former student at [ICHK](https://www.ichk.edu.hk), and has an interest in programming and computers in general. Over the past 4 years, Ray has worked on development of the Gibbon core, starting with small bug fixes and graduating to adding new back-end functions and building new features. In addition, Ray has also developed two additional modules for Gibbon: Help Desk and a Trip Planner, both of which are available on [our Extend page](https://gibbonedu.org/extend/).
