Sandra works at [International College Hong Kong](https://www.ichk.edu.hk/), applying code and design to tackle the many interesting projects that arise at a school. She has worked in a mix of industries—from oilfield training to virtual worlds—and now enjoys the positive impact of designing for education. Gibbon’s open source teacher-focused philosophy has been a perfect fit, and she hopes to see the developer community continue to grow.
