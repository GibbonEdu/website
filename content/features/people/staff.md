Advertise job openings, and accept applications against them. Take applicants and turn them into staff members, creating accounts automatically. Create a shared directory of staff, giving relevant users access to brief or full details. For example, allow parents to quickly contact staff based on email addresses, whilst allowing school administrators to view full personal details for HR and payroll. Input and track contract details. Use Data Updater to allow staff to keep their own details up to date.
