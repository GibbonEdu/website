The Student Profile brings together information on individual students from across the system and makes it available to appropriate people in a single place. The Fast Student Finder on the homepage makes it incredibly quick for teachers to find students. Student listings throughout the system provide teachers with links back to the Student Profile for quick access to other important data. Academic, behavioural, medical and SEN alerts are generated from system-wide data, and presented for quick access to those who need to know.

Also, use the Application Form to allow members of the public to apply for school places online. Manage a priority-based queue of applications, and accept or reject  applicants at any time. Automatically create user accounts and family links for accepted students and their parents, including assignment of usernames and passwords.
