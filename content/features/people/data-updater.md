Empower certain users (staff, parents) to update personal and medical data for members of their families, allowing schools to keep data updated without the need for paper forms. Update requests enter a queue for processing by an administrator, and can be amended by the creator at any time. Generate reports for flexible groups of students showing last update date, and use these in trip planning.
