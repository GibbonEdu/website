Create notes outlining both positive and negative student behaviour. Describe behaviour with school generated descriptor and severity lists, along with individual comments and details of followup. View notes by form group or individual student. Form group tutors see summary of recent activity on their homepage. Students receive likes for positive behaviour, and can view when, why and by whom they were deemed meritorious.
