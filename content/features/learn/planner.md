Incorporate lessons into units and automatically aggregate details through Departments. Assign homework, collect student work online and then tie it to a Markbook for grading. Create outcomes and assign them to units, allowing for curriculum mapping. Invite participants to peer assess each othersâ€™ work through Crowd Assessment.
