Capture details of both Internal and External Assessments taken by students, and allow teachers to use the data to improve understanding of their students. Includes CATS tests by default, but other tests can be added with no programming required. Take the time to convert test scores to a school-wide scale, and the system will automatically calculate a value-added score for each student, based on data drawn from the Markbook.
