Quickly and easily send messages out to flexible groups of users drawn from other areas of the system, such as students and parents from a particular form group, teaching class or activity.  Supported message formats include email, SMS and Message Wall. Use the message wall to produce an individualised, live daily bulletin of announcements. Include attachments in the form of links, files or HTML, drawn direct from the school wide resource bank.
