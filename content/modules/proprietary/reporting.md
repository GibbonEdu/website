description: Gibbon provides inbuilt tools for continuous assessment, but lacks support for traditional report writing and publishing. An extended, proprietary version of Rapid 36’s open source reporting module (see above) is available for those schools requiring extra functionality, customisation or support. Contact [Andy Statham](mailto:andy@statham.com) for sales information.
