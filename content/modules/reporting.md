description: Gibbon provides inbuilt tools for continuous assessment, but lacks support for traditional report writing and publishing. An extended, proprietary version of Rapid 36â€™s open source reporting module (see above) is available for those schools requiring extra functionality, customisation or support. Contact Andy Statham for sales information.
