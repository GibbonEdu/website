description: A solution for producing PDF reports to formally feedback student progress to parents, students and other schools.Documentation included in the /documents folders within the module. <br/><br/><b>In previous versions, if you ran the start of year process and then ran it again you would end up with repeated sections in the PDF report. This update addresses that issue by preventing duplicate sections from being created by adding an index to the table arrReportSection. Before you run the update you must make sure that none of your reports have any repeated sections otherwise the update will not work.  Delete all duplicates then run the update. For those who like to look inside the tables you can check arrReportSection.  Duplicate records are ones with the same reportID and sectionOrder.</b>
