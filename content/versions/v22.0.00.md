  text: "“Faai Di Laa” (快啲啦, faai3 di1 laa1) is Cantonese for ‘hurry up’ or ‘go faster’, and is used to communicate a need for speed. This might be used with a bus or taxi driver, an employee or someone on the street, but may be perceived as impolite."

Welcome to Gibbon v22.0.00 (Faai Di Laa). This is one of our largest releases in the past few years, including numerous front and back-end changes. Following our last release, v21 Ee Gaa (Cantonese for ‘right now’), v22 Faai Di Laa builds on the momentum with the encouragement to “Hurry up!”. The most noticeable change in this version is a new theme, updating Gibbon’s look and feel, which includes eight built-in theme colours. This version also includes new custom field options for many areas of the system, personal document settings, a dashboard enrolment tab, staff data updates, and more than 100 other enhancements.

On the technical side, v22 includes PHP 8 support, increases the minimum PHP version to 7.3, and includes a number of structural changes to the database. <u>Be sure to backup before updating and read the Changes With Important Notices in the changelog</u>.

It has been a pleasure to note a distinct strengthening of our community through the last 2 releases. Our forums now regularly feature peer-to-peer advice, new names and faces abound, the Gibbon map is growing and we’ve certified our first Official Partners. Despite this growth, the tone of our interactions remain positive, polite, friendly and true to the spirit of Gibbon. We are proud to be part of this growing movement of educators!

Our appreciation goes out to everyone who continues to work hard to translate Gibbon into their language. Thanks to your ongoing efforts Gibbon is available in 22 languages! We did not add any new languages this release, however there were lots of improvements to translation strings in the interface.

If you would like to volunteer to translate Gibbon into your language, please email [support@gibbonedu.org](mailto:support@gibbonedu.org).
