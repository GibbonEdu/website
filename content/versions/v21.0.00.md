Welcome to Gibbon v21.0.00 (Ee Gaa). Our most noticeable change is a visual improvement to the appearance of forms and menus. This release also includes new Data Retention and Data Privacy functionality, improved tools and information for System Administrators, Report emailing tools, MySQL 8 compatibility, and more than 140 other enhancements.

Continuing the amazing work of our volunteer translators, Gibbon v21 adds both Afrikaans and Ukrainian as active languages. Our appreciation goes out to everyone who has worked hard to translate Gibbon into their language: thanks to your ongoing efforts Gibbon is now available in 22 languages!

If you would like to volunteer to translate Gibbon into your language, please email [support@gibbonedu.org](mailto:support@gibbonedu.org).
