Our appreciation goes out to the volunteers who work hard to translate Gibbon into their language: thanks to your ongoing efforts Gibbon is now available in 17 languages! Special thanks to Koala Yeung and Leonardo Freitas, who have joined the Gibbon core team and contributed many lines of code to our ongoing codebase refactoring.

If you would like to volunteer to translate Gibbon into your language, please email [support@gibbonedu.org](mailto:support@gibbonedu.org).

### Important Notes for v17.0.00

- We’ve increased the minimum PHP version to 7.0. Please check to ensure your server supports this requirement before upgrading.  At this time PHP 7.2 is the highest recommended version, and 7.3+ should only be used in development.
- Always backup your files and database before upgrading.
- Please read the Changes With Important Notices section of /CHANGELOG.txt before you install, to see if your upgrade requires any manual intervention.
- See the [Updating Gibbon](https://docs.gibbonedu.org/administrators/getting-started/updating-gibbon/) guide for detailed steps.
