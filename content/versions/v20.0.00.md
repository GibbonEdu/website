  text: "Ding Ding Che (Chinese 叮叮車) is the oldest transport on HK Island. In addition to being used by commuters, the system is popular with tourists, and is one of the most environmentally friendly ways of travelling in the city. Hong Kong people informally call the tramway the \"Ding Ding\" (叮叮), in reference to the double-bell ring used by the trams to warn pedestrians of their approach."

Welcome to Gibbon v20.0.00 (Ding Ding Che). This release, which mainly focuses on maintenance and stability, includes background email sending in Messenger, a new View Logs interface for browsing Gibbon events, PHP 7.4 compatibility and more than 75 other enhancements.

Gibbon’s internationalisation continues to be strengthened, thanks to the hard work of Leonardo Freitas and our team of volunteer translators, whose efforts we greatly appreciate. If you would like to volunteer to translate Gibbon into your language, please email [support@gibbonedu.org](mailto:support@gibbonedu.org).

### Important Notes for v20.0.00

- Gibbon v20 does not yet support MySQL 8. We are working to add this support into Gibbon v21, releasing January 20, 2020.
- Since v17, Gibbon requires a minimum PHP version of 7.0. Please check to ensure your server supports this requirement before upgrading. Gibbon v20 has been tested up to PHP 7.4, which is the highest recommended version.
- Always backup your files and database before upgrading.
- See the [Updating Gibbon](https://docs.gibbonedu.org/administrators/getting-started/updating-gibbon/) guide for detailed steps.
