Welcome to Gibbon v21.0.01 (Ee Gaa). Our most noticeable change is a visual improvement to the appearance of forms and menus. This release also includes new Data Retention and Data Privacy functionality, improved tools and information for System Administrators, Report emailing tools, MySQL 8 compatibility, and more than 140 other enhancements.

Continuing the amazing work of our volunteer translators, Gibbon v21 adds both Afrikaans and Ukrainian as active languages. Our appreciation goes out to everyone who has worked hard to translate Gibbon into their language: thanks to your ongoing efforts Gibbon is now available in 22 languages!

If you would like to volunteer to translate Gibbon into your language, please email [support@gibbonedu.org](mailto:support@gibbonedu.org).

<hr/>

v21.0.01 is a minor version release which addresses an issue identified in the Attendance > Students Not Onsite and Students Not Present reports, which were missing some attendance logs when using Attendance by Class. This minor release also includes additional improvements made since the v21 release. We highly recommend all administrators running v21 to update their systems to this latest version.

Although this is not a security issue, there is the potential for it to impact student health and safety in the case of an emergency evacuation, at a school using the Students Not Onsite and Students Not Present reports. As such, we felt it prudent to push this fix as a minor release, and announce its availability by email.


### Important Notes for v21.0.01

- Since v17, Gibbon requires a minimum PHP version of 7.0. Please check to ensure your server supports this requirement before upgrading. Gibbon v21 has been tested up to PHP 7.4, which is the highest recommended version. Gibbon does not yet support PHP 8.
- Always backup your files and database before upgrading.
- If you are upgrading, please read the Changes With Important Notices section of [CHANGELOG.txt](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/core/blob/main/CHANGELOG.txt) before you install, to see if your upgrade requires any manual intervention.
- See the [Updating Gibbon](https://docs.gibbonedu.org/administrators/getting-started/updating-gibbon/) guide for detailed steps.
