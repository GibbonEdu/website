  text: "‘Ha Gao’ (蝦餃, har gow) is a traditional Cantonese dumpling served in dim sum. The dumpling is sometimes called a shrimp bonnet for its pleated shape. This dish is often served together with siumaai; when served in such a manner the two items are collectively referred to as hagaau-shaomai (蝦餃燒賣, xiājiǎo shāomài). Har Gow, Siu Mai, Char Siu Bao, and Egg tarts are considered the classic dishes of Cantonese cuisine and referred to as The Four Heavenly Kings. (四大天王, sì dà tiān wáng)"

Welcome to Gibbon v24.0.01 (Ha Gao). We’re pleased to announce the addition of a new Admissions module along with flexible Form Builder functionality. Together, these new features enable schools to customize their application forms and give administrators more tools for tracking and working with applicants. Given the scope of these changes, we’ve marked them as beta for v24, and the original application form is still in place and fully functional. For the initial release of the Form Builder we’ve focused on ensuring the application functionality is robust and stable, and in the future this feature will enable creating other types of forms in Gibbon. 

The v24 release also includes a new Multi-Factor Authentication option for users, iCal timetable export, improved user photo uploader, and more than 50 other enhancements and improvements.

Our appreciation goes out to everyone who continues to work hard to translate Gibbon into their language. Thanks to your ongoing efforts Gibbon is available in 22 languages! If you would like to volunteer to translate Gibbon into your language, please email [support@gibbonedu.org](mailto:support@gibbonedu.org).
