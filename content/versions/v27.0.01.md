  text: "Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden (KFBG) (Chinese: 嘉道理農場暨植物園), was originally set up to aid poor farmers in the New Territories in Hong Kong. It later shifted its focus to promote biodiversity conservation in Hong Kong and south China, and greater environmental awareness. It is located near Pak Ngau Shek, encompassing Kwun Yam Shan in the central New Territories; The Farm was built in a valley with streams, woodlands and terraces in 1956 by the Kadoorie Agricultural Aid Association. Now it is managed to integrate nature conservation, including a rescue and rehabilitation programme for native animals, along with holistic education and practices in support of a transition to sustainable living."

Welcome to Gibbon v27.0.01 (Kadoorie Farm). This version brings a wide range of backend enhancements, including improved PHP 8.2 compatibility, updates to Google OAuth and jQuery libraries, date localization, and loads of ongoing refactoring. The frontend offers a fresh new UI for the Library module and an auto-save system when creating new lesson plans.

Our first attempt at an April release was scuppered by upstream Google integration changes, and so this version has arrived in May instead. The extra time has been used for quality control, with the aim of offering a stable version at release. Going forward we plan to stick as closely as possible to our new April/November 20th release cycle.

The Gibbon Foundation is now fully up and running, representing a massive milestone for our community. We hope to announce a new supporter system in November (alongside v28), which will allow schools to choose to donate ongoing financial support to our project, allowing us to ensure Gibbon’s long term future. In the meantime, if you’d like to offer us a leg-up on this front, please consider using the buttons below to make a one-time donation:

Gibbon v27 improves type-checking and support for PHP 8.2, with a continued minimum requirement of PHP 7.4 and MySQL 5.7. If you’re running Gibbon on PHP 8.3+, it is still recommended to turn off deprecation messages through php.ini, as these messages are only intended for development purposes.

A heartfelt thank you to everyone who continues to work hard to translate Gibbon into their own language. Thanks to your ongoing efforts Gibbon is available in 24 languages! If you would like to volunteer to translate Gibbon into your language, please email [support@gibbonedu.org](mailto:support@gibbonedu.org).
