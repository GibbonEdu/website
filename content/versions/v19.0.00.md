Welcome to Gibbon v19.0.00 (Cha Chaan Teng). This release includes a brand new academic Reports module, complete with a visual template designer and intuitive report writing and proof reading. In addition, you’ll find a new staff directory, Individual Needs investigations, pinned messages for your Gibbon landing page, and more than 80 other improvements.

Gibbon is now available in German! Thanks to the hard work of our volunteer translators, Gibbon is becoming a truly global platform, with support for 20 languages. Our thanks go out to the translators who have worked to make Gibbon available in their languages!  

If you would like to volunteer to translate Gibbon into your language, please email [support@gibbonedu.org](mailto:support@gibbonedu.org).

### Important Notes for v19.0.00

- Since v17, Gibbon requires a minimum PHP version of 7.0. Please check to ensure your server supports this requirement before upgrading. Gibbon v19 has been tested up to PHP 7.3, which is the highest recommended version. Support for PHP 7.4 is planned for Gibbon v20.
- Always backup your files and database before upgrading.
- Please read the Changes With Important Notices section of /CHANGELOG.txt before you install, to see if your upgrade requires any manual intervention.
