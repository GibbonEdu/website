  text: "A Bo Lo Bao (Pineapple Bun; Chinese: 菠蘿包) is a kind of sweet bun predominantly popular in Hong Kong and also common in Chinatowns worldwide. Despite the name, it does not traditionally contain pineapple; rather, the name refers to the look of the characteristic topping (which resembles the texture of a pineapple)."

We're excited to announce Gibbon v18.0.00 (Bo Lo Bao) introduces the first mobile-responsive capabilities to the Gibbon core. This is a milestone release, building on the past several versions of back-end refactoring, and represents the next major steps in improving the Gibbon user experience. We aim to continue this momentum in upcoming versions, with additional interface improvements and themeing capabilities.

This version also introduces new functionality for tracking staff absences and substitute coverage, mobile-friendly HTML email templates, improvements to attendance tracking, fine-grained data updater controls, and more than 60 other fixes, tweaks and improvements.

Continuing the amazing work of our volunteer translators, Gibbon v18 adds both Urdu and Croatian as active languages. Our appreciation goes out to everyone who has worked hard to translate Gibbon into their language: thanks to your ongoing efforts Gibbon is now available in 19 languages!

If you would like to volunteer to translate Gibbon into your language, please email [support@gibbonedu.org](mailto:support@gibbonedu.org).

- Always backup your files and database before upgrading.
- Please read the Changes With Important Notices section of /CHANGELOG.txt before you install, to see if your upgrade requires any manual intervention.
