title: "Gibbon Foundation"

The Gibbon Foundation is a non-profit body that oversees the development, maintenance and long-term health of the Gibbon open source project.

Gibbon adds value to a wide range of schools and organisations around the world, without any fees or licencing costs. Our focus is on quality education for all—not profit—and we believe that this is how school software should be.

Nonetheless, building and maintaining quality software comes with costs, which have grown in proportion with the size of our community.

We invite those schools which benefit from Gibbon, and who have the means, to consider offering us financial support. Such contributions <strong>allow us to ensure the sustainability of Gibbon as a reliable and robust platform that all schools can rely on for the long run</strong>. 

There are three different ways to do this:

- <strong>[Foundation Membership](mailto:support@gibbonedu.org)</strong> - Signal your commitment by becoming a member of the Gibbon Foundation. Membership includes an annual fee, gives you access to three online Foundation meetings per year between developers and other members, and your school would join a public list of members. Please contact us at support@gibbonedu.org for more information.

- <strong>[Catalyst License](https://gibbonedu.com)</strong> - Support Gibbon development by purchasing a Catalyst License. This gives you access to a suite of useful queries and commands in Query Builder. This license is offered in partnership with Gibbon Education Limited.
<br><br>
- <strong>[Flex Donation](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/gibbonedu)</strong> - Contribute any amount at any time. We appreciate that not all schools are in a position to offer such support, whilst thankfully receiving support from those schools who are.
