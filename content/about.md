<img src="/img/gibbon-logo.png" class="float-right w-32 sm:w-48 md:w-64 -mt-10 ml-4 mb-4">Gibbon was founded in October 2010 in response to a lack of powerful, usable and open source school platforms. Right from the beginning, Gibbon was designed to be flexible, extensible and themeable, whilst aiming to help teachers to do their jobs. 

The project aims to provide all schools, no matter their size or resources they have, with the systems they need to provide effective learning, teaching and school management. Gibbon is built using [PHP](http://php.net/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [jQuery,](https://jquery.com/) [Git](http://github.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) and other open tools.

    Watching gibbons play is like nothing else on earth: they show astounding flexibility, speed, and grace as they swing, run, and jump. Their sense of fun is almost tangible in the air around them. Although lofty, these attributes are what the Gibbon project, an education management system, aspires to bring to schools and colleges.
