Thanks to Marcus Ko and Martin Donnet at <a href="http://www.ichk.edu.hk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICHK Secondary</a>, we are pleased to share design files allowing you to 3d print your own Gibbon logo figurine:

You can download a <a href="https://gibbonedu.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/3D-Gibbon.stl_.zip">compressed, printable STL file here</a> (it's CC BY-SA-NC licensed, so feel free to remix, but do share alike).

We are hoping that the next version will have a small loop so that these can be used as keychains and bag tags. In the meantime, if you use this file, please <a href="https://twitter.com/gibbonedu?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share the image with us via Twitter</a>.
