The Gibbon Hackathon 2019 is a chance for passionate programmers to contribute to the Gibbon open source school platform. We hope to combine the knowledge of experienced Gibbon programmers with the enthusiasm of new comers to the community, to work on [new features for Gibbon v18](https://docs.gibbonedu.org/developers/getting-started/gibbon-road-map/). Details in the poster below (click for a larger version).

This year the hackathon will be hosted at Ross' house, where we'll plan for a day of coding, fresh baked bread & BBQ. We'll meet 9:30am at Tai Wo MTR, northbound platform exit. Let us know if you plan to attend so we can arrange to meet up.

Please email [support@gibbonedu.org](mailto:support@gibbonedu.org) for enquiries and registration.
