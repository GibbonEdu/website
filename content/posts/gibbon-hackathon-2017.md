Join us for Gibbon Hackathon 2017, our second annual community coding event. This is a chance for passionate programmers to contribute to the Gibbon open source school platform. We hope to combine the knowledge of experienced Gibbon programmers with the enthusiasm of new comers to the community, to work on [new features for Gibbon v15][1]. Details in the poster below (click for a larger version). Supported by <a href="http://www.tis.edu.mo" target="_blank">The International School of Macao</a>, click [here][2] for directions.
